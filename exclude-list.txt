# List of packages to exclude from the docs.  This is an escape hatch in case a
# package causes a problem while building the package docs and we want to
# exclude it temporarily.
#
# Blank lines and these comments are ignored.

# dylan-tool has been replaced by deft and there isn't yet a package property
# to indicate exclusion from the docs.
